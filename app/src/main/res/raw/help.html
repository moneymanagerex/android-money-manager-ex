<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
MoneyManagerEx for Android is a port of the PC/Desktop personal finance application, currently available for Windows, Mac OSX and LINUX. It maintains the best features of its sisters' Desktop applications, while adding mobility and synchronization.
<p></p>
The primary goal of MoneyManagerEx for Android and <strong>MoneyManagerEx for Android</strong> is to simplify the process of tracking financial information, in an easy to use program that can be used as regular as necessary, to help us keep track of where our money comes from and more importantly, where our money goes, in order to make better financial decisions for our future.
<p></p>
Think of MoneyManagerEx for Android and <strong>MoneyManagerEx for Android</strong> as a computer checkbook which enables you to balance your accounts, organize, manage and generate reports for your finances.
<p></p>
<strong>With MoneyManagerEx for Android, and synchronization via Dropbox, you can keep under control your finances, no matter where you will find.</strong>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="Concepts"></a>Concepts</h2>
MoneyManagerEx is organizing the finance real through the concepts of operations.
<p></p>
<strong>Deposit</strong> (Income): when you receive money from someone, or a service we provide for the sale of a product.<br>
<strong>Withdrawal</strong> (Expenses): when you spend money for a service that uses or to purchase a product.<br>
<strong>Payees</strong>: are all those who give or receive money from us.<br>
<strong>Accounts</strong>: are all places where we keep the money, such as banks, several institutions or even our pockets.<br>
<strong>Transaction</strong>: when we spend or receive money.<br>
<strong>Category</strong>: identifies the reason for the transaction income or expense.<br>
<strong>Transfer</strong>: transfer money from one place to another.<br>
<strong>Currency</strong>: used to perform the transactions.<br>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="Database"></a>Database</h2>
The database that MoneyManagerEx for Android generates, known as the <strong>.mmb</strong> file, becomes an important file for you to maintain. Depending on circumstances, security features such as encryption can be employed, which is recognized as a <strong>.emb</strong> file. This is where we can attach a password to the database, and will require a password every time MoneyManagerEx for Android is opened.
<strong><em>Unfortunately, the encryption features of the database </em></strong>.emb* is not yet available for the Android version_<strong></strong>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Encrypted_Database"></a>Encrypted Database</h3>
<strong>Important: <em>MoneyManagerEx for Android is not currently able to open the encrypted database (. Emb). Why? Android SQLite does not provide  encryption of databases, and unfortunately is not yet available a porting library wxSQLite on Android.</em></strong><br>
MoneyManagerEx for Android, has a feature that allows you to enter a Passcode to protect the data on your device.

<h2><a name="Accounts"></a>Accounts</h2>

<p></p>
To create a new account, from the menu, Manage &rarr; Account &rarr; Add (+)
<p></p>
<strong>Name of the Account</strong>: This is a required field. The recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to real world accounts. Example: With <a href="CitiBank">CitiBank</a>, we have a Savings account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your accounts as "<a href="CitiBank">CitiBank</a> Savings" and "Citibank Visa".<br>
<p></p>
<strong>Type of Account</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>"Checking" Account</strong>: This is the most common type of account such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and credit card accounts. It supports three types of operations: deposit, withdrawal and transfer.</li>
<li><strong>"Term" Account</strong>: This kinds of accounts cover specialized accounts such as Cash Term Accounts, Bank Mortgage accounts, Loan accounts, or investment accounts with regular income or expenditure that you need to keep track of. <br></li>
</ol>
To keep track of more information on the accounts, you can insert the optional details of the account, such as account number, address, website, contact information and access. You can also enter additional notes on the account in the 'Notes'.
For a correct management you must have the correct balance for the account you are entering, and this information must be entered in the "Initial Balance". Later to keep the account balance is sufficient to add the transactions that take place gradually over the date of the opening balance entered.
<p></p>
The <strong>Status</strong> of the account can be set to "Open" or "Closed". Closed accounts are those no longer active. The setting of this state is only one way to simplify the vision. When you start the application displays all the Accounts, but you can make it visible only open account by setting "View open accounts" (Manage &rarr; Settings &rarr; Display)
<p></p>
<strong>Currency</strong>: You can set the currency associated with the account and can be different to the base currency. The exchange rate of the currency can be changed using the menu: Manage &rarr; Currency
