# Build

To build the project, the following settings are recommended:

- current stable version of Android Studio, 2.3.2;
- use JDK 1.8.0.112, (embedded JDK runs out of memory on compilation);
- Gradle 3.5;

You will need to generate a custom "fabric.properties" file in "app" directory.

## Travis CI

Travis CI build is active for the project.
Useful content is available at the Fabric/Travis [demo](https://github.com/plastiv/CrashlyticsDemo). It explains how to generate fabric.properties file during the build, using environment variables.
The environment variables start with org_gradle_project, i.e. ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_crashlyticsdemoApikey.
